## XRTool

A real-time 3D point cloud registration(matching) algorithm library for iOS, combining the **3D point cloud** captured from **LiDAR** and movement information captured from **CoreMotion**. With this library you can use an iOS device with LiDAR to detect key feature points in the 3D point cloud, and the algorithm will automatically find match of them to the pre-stored CAD model. Matched feature points combination will then be used as an anchor point at which the virtual object will be placed into the AR world.

``` ```
### What Did I Do
- Collaborate closely with an **international team**. Analyze the clients requirements, design the solution
- Implement key **computer vision** algorithms with Apple’s frameworks such as **Metal**, **Metal Performance Shader** and  **CoreMotion**, as well as **OpenCV**, **Eigen3** and **PointCloud**
- Visualize the algorithm’s internal states and final results with **ARKit** and **RealityKit**/**SceneKit**/**Metal**
- Read, parse and render 3D model files in **USDZ** format with **RealityKit**
- Implement the UI for our prototype app with **SwiftUI** and **UIKit** combined

``` ```
### Tech Stack
ARKit, RealityKit/SceneKit, Metal, MPS(Metal Performance Shader), SwiftUI, PointCloud, OpenCV, Eigen3
