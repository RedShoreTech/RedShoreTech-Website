## A Shadertoy Fan's "homebrewed" iOS App

An iOS app for showing Shadertoy.com shaders with pure native **OpenGL(ES) & GLSL**. 

All Shadertoy CG artworks are exhibited alive in water flow. It can also record your favorite shaders into videos or Live Photo which can be set as iOS Live Wallpapers. 

Once went into **Top#50 in Graphics&Design category of App Store**.

  ``` ```
### What I did:
- Use **AFNetworking** for fetching data with **REST APIs** powered by Shadertoy Public API
- Persistent data with **SQLite/CoreData**
- UI implemented with **UIKit/SwiftUI**
- Implement **rendering pipeline** with iOS native **OpenGL(ES) and GLSL**, instead of using WebGL as the official iOS app of Shadertoy.com does, making the rendering much more smoother and robust

``` ```
### Tech Stack
UIKit, SwiftUI, SQLite/CoreData, OpenGLES, GLSL, AFNetworking, AVFoundation, CoreGraphics, CoreVideo
