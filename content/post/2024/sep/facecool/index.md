## FaceCool APP (iOS)

An iOS **facial recognition** app using a library ported from Android implemented with **NCNN** and **OpenCV** , achieving stable tracking and recognition accuracy of more than 93%.

``` ```
### What Did I Do
- Port the facial recognition **Android NDK** library into **iOS**
- Use **Apple’s Vision framework** for **face detection** and tracking
- Deal with the different behaviors of **Google’s MLKit** and **Apple’s Vision frameworks** in face detection and tracking
- Debug issues with **Instrument** and optimize memory usage and performance
- Design and implement the UI for the prototype demo

``` ```
### Tech Stack
MLKit(Android), Vision, SwiftUI/UIKit, CoreData, CoreGraphics

``` ```
